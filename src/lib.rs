//! # Exercises!
//! A small library with advent of code-like exercises to test your Rust skills.
//! Try running the tests using `cargo test`.
//! If you want to run a single module's tests or a specific test,
//! just enter a unique prefix such as `cargo test -- exercise1`.
//!
//! # Note
//! All functions you implement do not error-handling unless specified.
//! They are only expected to work with respect to the corresponding exercise text file.
