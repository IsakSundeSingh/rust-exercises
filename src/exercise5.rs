/// The trait `Iterator` is really common and ingrained in Rust
/// It is used for iterating over values and is implemented for nearly
/// every standard-library type you'd need it for. It is also required to make
/// for-loops work. We can create our own Iterator-trait like this:
trait MyIterator {
    /// The type that is returned for each iteration
    type Item;

    /// Advances the iterator and returns the next value, or [`None`]
    /// if the iterator is depleted.
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;

    /// Trait methods can have a default-implementation, that use other
    /// methods that are only described in the trait as their implementation.
    /// This is how implementing only [`Self::Item`] and [`Self::next`] is
    /// necessary to get all the nice Iterator-methods.
    ///
    /// Here is a method that returns folds over the iterator,
    /// only using the [`Self::next`]-method.
    fn fold<Accumulator, F>(mut self, init: Accumulator, mut f: F) -> Accumulator
    where
        // This just means the type has a compile-time determined size (e.g. 10 bytes, and not unknown).
        Self: Sized,
        F: FnMut(Accumulator, Self::Item) -> Accumulator,
    {
        let mut accum = init;
        while let Some(x) = self.next() {
            accum = f(accum, x);
        }
        accum
