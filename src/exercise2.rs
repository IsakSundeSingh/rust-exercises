/// # Introducing... Traits!
///
/// Traits are Rust's answer to ad-hoc polymorphism, or in plain English:
/// how to constrain and add "behaviour" to generic types. Traits are
/// what makes generics useful.
///
/// Traits in Rust are similar to interfaces in languages like C# and Java,
/// but better. So more like Haskell's typeclasses, yet not fully that
/// powerful.
///
/// Traits are introduced using the `trait` keyword and then the name, followed
/// by a block describing the trait. An empty body means the trait is called a
/// "marker trait". It just marks a value. Rust internally uses this for a lot
/// of different tricks.

/// This is a struct that has an anonymous field (`0`).
/// It is a distinct type and cannot be confused for another `u32`.
/// This is called a newtype pattern.
